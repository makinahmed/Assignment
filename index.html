            <p> Hey! I am Makin.I am studying at Prime University since 2019.I belongs to Computer Science and
                Engineering Department. I don't know which word can tell about myself. So, Les's know about dream ! Like everybody I have also so many dreams, but above all is apotheosis and
                becoming as mentally developed as
                self-controlled as possible, so that the experience of life itself can be directed how I desire. I set
                out a long time ago to find this ability, to overpower all the malaises and neurotic aspects in my life
                and find a way to experience it with maximum enjoyment and minimal stress.</p>
            <p>
                I’ve probably achieved that quite well. I’ve reached a state where my theories of life all fit and do
                not contradict, where I can entertain many ideas and understand how the world actually works, and I’m
                not in conflict with either myself or this existence. When I look back I see the distance travelled has
                been immense, in the landscape of the mind, at least.
